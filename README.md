The purpose of the application is to develope an android app using kotline that provides meal suggestions depending on the time of day.

The design considerations
•	The suggest meal button will be used to generate the type of meal you should eat and once that meal is generated the time bar automatically reset’s itself
•	The meal suggestion will show the different types of meals you can have
•	My content is written in bold serrif
•	To search for your meal suggestion, you need to clear the” insert your current time” with single digit or double digit for it to give you your meal suggestions
•	The main colors used in the app is purple and black
(I have updated my app to add the reset button and a more appealing user face)
